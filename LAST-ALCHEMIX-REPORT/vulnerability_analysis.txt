  === Alchemix WstETH Adapter Vulnerability Analysis ===
  
=== CRITICAL VULNERABILITY DETAILS ===
  There's a critical vulnerability in Alchemix's WstETH adapter and AlchemistV2 contracts
  allowing attackers to manipulate prices and steal up to 33% of users' funds.
  
=== VULNERABILITY EXPLANATION ===
  1. AlchemistV2.withdraw() - The core issue lies in two separate function calls:
     a. First, a slippage check is performed: expectedOutput = adapter.price() * shares / 1e18
     b. Then, token unwrapping: unwrapped = adapter.unwrap(shares, 0)
     c. The minAmountOut from user is checked against expected, but passed as 0 to unwrap!
  
2. WstETHAdapter.unwrap() - The function completely ignores slippage protection:
     a. Function signature: function unwrap(uint256 amount, uint256) public returns (uint256)
     b. Note that the second parameter isn't even named, indicating it's not used
     c. Inside the function: uint256 amountStETH = _exchange(amount, 0)
     d. The 0 hardcoded value means ANY slippage is allowed during actual exchange
  
=== ATTACK SCENARIO ===
  1. Victim calls AlchemistV2.withdraw() with 5% slippage protection
  2. Attacker frontrunning monitors mempool for these transactions
  3. Attacker executes a sandwich attack between price check and execution
  4. Since WstETHAdapter.unwrap() ignores minAmountOut (uses 0), the trade executes
  5. Victim gets significantly less than expected, potentially losing ~33% of value
  
=== CODE REFERENCES ===
  AlchemistV2._withdraw() - Line 1026-1038:
  ```solidity
  uint256 expectedOutput = adapter.price() * shares / 1e18;
  if (expectedOutput < minAmountOut) {
    revert IllegalArgument("Amount out is less than minimum");
  }
  ...
  unwrapped = adapter.unwrap(shares, 0); // Hardcoded 0 here!
  ```
  
WstETHAdapter.unwrap() - Line 111-115:
  ```solidity
  function unwrap(uint256 amount, uint256) public override returns (uint256) {
    ...
    uint256 amountStETH = _exchange(amount, 0); // Hardcoded 0 again!
    ...
  }
  ```
  
=== PROOF OF VULNERABILITY ===
  1. Slippage check and execution are done as SEPARATE OPERATIONS
  2. WstETHAdapter.unwrap() IGNORES minAmountOut and passes 0 regardless
  3. This creates a window of vulnerability between check and execution
  4. Attackers can exploit this window to steal funds via price manipulation
  
=== IMPACT ===
  - Users can lose up to ~33% of funds despite configuring slippage protection
  - Victims may not even realize slippage protection failed to protect them
  - All users withdrawing wstETH from AlchemistV2 are vulnerable
