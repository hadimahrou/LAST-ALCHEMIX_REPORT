  === ALCHEMIX VULNERABILITY: ATTACK SIMULATION ===
  
=== SCENARIO PARAMETERS ===
  Victim shares to withdraw: 10 shares
  Initial wstETH price: 1 ETH
  Victim slippage setting: 5 %
  Attacker's target manipulated price: 0 ETH
  Price manipulation: 33 %
  
=== STEP 1: SLIPPAGE CHECK PHASE ===
  Expected output (based on initial price): 12 wstETH
  Minimum acceptable output with
  5 % slippage: 11 wstETH
  AlchemistV2: expectedOutput >= minAmountOut? YES, proceed
  
=== STEP 2: PRICE MANIPULATION PHASE ===
  Attacker frontrunning the transaction
  Price manipulation technique:
  1. Large sell of wstETH before victim transaction
  2. Price temporarily drops by 33 %
  3. wstETH price now: 0 ETH
  
=== STEP 3: EXECUTION PHASE ===
  AlchemistV2 calls: adapter.unwrap(shares, 0) <-- Note hardcoded 0
  WstETHAdapter calls: _exchange(amount, 0) <-- Note hardcoded 0 again
  Actual output with manipulated price: 8 wstETH
  Loss from expected output: 4 wstETH
  Loss percentage: 33 %
  
=== STEP 4: VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS ===
  Was victim's slippage setting respected? NO!
  Minimum acceptable by victim: 11 wstETH
  Actually received: 8 wstETH
  SLIPPAGE PROTECTION FAILED: Received less than minimum acceptable!
  Additional loss beyond allowed slippage:
  28 %
  
=== STEP 5: ATTACKER PROFITS ===
  Attacker buys back wstETH at lower price after victim's transaction
  Profit from sandwich attack:
  3 wstETH equivalent
  (Accounting for ~10% trading costs/slippage)
  
=== CONCLUSION ===
  Despite victim setting 5 % slippage protection,
  They lost 33 % of expected value
  Root cause: Adapter ignores slippage parameter and uses hardcoded 0
