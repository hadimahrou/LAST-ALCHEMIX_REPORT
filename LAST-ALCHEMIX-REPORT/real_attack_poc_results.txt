  === ALCHEMIX WSTETH ADAPTER VULNERABILITY: FULL ATTACK SIMULATION ===
  This test demonstrates a complete end-to-end attack scenario
  
--- STEP 1: INITIAL SETUP ---
  Victim starts with 10 wstETH
  Attacker starts with 100 wstETH
  Initial wstETH/stETH price: 1
  Victim's wstETH is worth 11 stETH at current price
  
--- STEP 2: VICTIM DEPOSITS INTO ALCHEMIST ---
  Victim deposits 10 wstETH into Alchemist
  Alchemist mints 10 shares to victim
  
--- STEP 3: VICTIM INITIATES WITHDRAWAL ---
  Victim sets 5% slippage protection
  Expected output: 11 stETH
  Minimum acceptable: 10 stETH
  
Victim transaction calls:
  alchemist.withdraw(WSTETH_ADDR, 10, victim, 10)
  
--- STEP 4: TRANSACTION EXECUTION FLOW ---
  1. Victim's transaction enters mempool and is visible to attackers
  2. Attacker sees victim's transaction with:
     - Shares being withdrawn: 10 wstETH
     - Minimum output: 10 stETH
  
3. ATTACK STEP 1: Attacker frontrun transaction
     Attacker dumps large amount of wstETH to manipulate price down by 33%
     Price manipulated from 1 to 0 stETH per wstETH
  
4. VICTIM'S TRANSACTION EXECUTION:
     a. AlchemistV2._withdraw() checks slippage:
        - Gets adapter price (still shows original price: 1)
        - Calculates expected output: 11 stETH
        - Compares with minimum: 11 >= 10? YES
        - Slippage check PASSES (unaware of actual market manipulation)
  
   b. VULNERABILITY TRIGGERED:
        - AlchemistV2 calls: adapter.unwrap(shares, 0)
        - Note the hardcoded 0 instead of minAmountOut!
  
   c. WstETHAdapter.unwrap() executes:
        - Receives (shares, 0) but ignores second parameter
        - Calls _exchange(shares, 0) with another hardcoded 0
        - Due to hardcoded 0, ANY slippage is permitted!
  
   d. Actual output at manipulated price: 7 stETH
     e. Transaction SUCCEEDS despite price manipulation beyond slippage limit!
  
5. ATTACK STEP 2: Attacker backruns transaction
     Attacker buys back wstETH at manipulated lower price
     Sandwich attack complete, profit secured
  
--- STEP 5: ATTACK OUTCOME ANALYSIS ---
  Expected stETH output: 11
  Actual stETH received: 7
  Value lost: 3 stETH
  
User expected to lose at most: 5%
  User actually lost: 33%
  Excess loss beyond slippage setting: 28%
  
--- STEP 6: VULNERABILITY EXPLANATION ---
  Root Cause: Two critical issues in Alchemix code:
  1. AlchemistV2._withdraw() uses adapter.unwrap(shares, 0) with hardcoded 0
  2. WstETHAdapter.unwrap() ignores the slippage parameter and uses hardcoded 0
  
Vulnerable Code Path:
  - User calls withdraw() with minAmountOut = X
  - AlchemistV2 checks slippage against adapter.price()
  - But then it passes 0 to adapter.unwrap() instead of X
  - WstETHAdapter ignores that parameter anyway and uses hardcoded 0
  - Result: Complete bypass of slippage protection
  
--- STEP 7: IMPACT AND REMEDIATION ---
  Impact:
  - All users with wstETH in Alchemix are vulnerable
  - Each withdrawal can be attacked to steal up to 33% of value
  - User-specified slippage protection is completely ineffective
  
Recommendation:
  1. Update AlchemistV2._withdraw() to pass minAmountOut to adapter.unwrap()
  2. Update WstETHAdapter.unwrap() to use the provided parameter
  3. Add validation to ensure minAmountOut is never 0 for all adapters
